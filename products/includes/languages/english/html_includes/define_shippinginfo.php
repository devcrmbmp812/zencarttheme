<p><strong>Shipping </strong></p>

<p><strong>Our shipping policy is done a little different than most.&nbsp; Because our products vary in size and weight so much there isn&#39;t a calculator at this time that can accurate estimate the items in your shopping cart to charge shipping when you purchase your items.&nbsp; We like to keep costs down for all our hobbyist and we know shipping is not something we want to pay too much on, so to make sure shipping is accurate we have a different process.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The process is this once you checkout for your products, we will receive the order, package the order, weigh and measure it.&nbsp; We then put it in our shipping software to give us competitive rates, we then choose between USPS or Fedex for the best rate (unless you specify you want it shipped differently).&nbsp; We will then send you an invoice to your email for the shipping rate and this will process through paypal.&nbsp; Once we receive the shipping payment we will ship your order.&nbsp; Yes this does take more time on our part, but we feel it is beneficial to our customers to be charged correctly.&nbsp; </strong></p>

<p><strong><u>One important note </u>is to make sure your email has us a a safe sender, or check your emails so it doesn&#39;t go to junk or spam.&nbsp; This tends to happen sometimes.&nbsp; The email that comes to you the subject line will read &quot;Boscoyo Studio LLC Payment Request&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Thank you!!</p>
